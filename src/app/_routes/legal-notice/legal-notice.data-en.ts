    <h3>2. Data Collection on this Website</h3>
    <h4>2a) Server Log Files</h4>
    <p>
        The provider of the pages automatically collects and stores information in so-called server log files, which your browser automatically transmits to us. These are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>IP address</li> 
        <li>Date and time of the request</li>
        <li>Hostname of the accessing computer</li>
        <li>Browser type and browser version</li>
        <li>Operating system used</li>
        <li>Referrer URL (the previously visited page)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This data is technically necessary to display our website to you and to ensure the security and stability of the system. This data is not merged with other data sources. The legal basis for the processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR (legitimate interest in the secure presentation of the website).
    </p>

    <h4>2b) Contact Form</h4>
    <p>
        If you send me inquiries via the contact form, your details from the inquiry form, including the contact details you provided there, will be stored by us for the purpose of processing the inquiry and in case of follow-up questions. We do not pass on this data without your consent.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>What data is collected?</strong> Name, email address, and the text of your message.

            <strong>Legal basis:</strong> The processing of this data is based on your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR) and/or the fulfillment of a contract or pre-contractual measures (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR). You can revoke your consent at any time.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Storage duration:</strong> The data you enter in the contact form will remain with us until you request us to delete it, revoke your consent, or the purpose for data storage no longer applies (e.g., after your inquiry has been fully processed). Mandatory legal provisions – especially retention periods – remain unaffected.
        </li>
    </ul>


    <h3>3. No Cookies</h3>
    <p>
        This website does not use cookies that would require the storage of data on the user's end device.
